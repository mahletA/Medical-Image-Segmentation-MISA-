% Note: The 3D MICO algorithm is used to segment a synthetic 3D MR image in
% this demo. The code only shows the original image and segmentation result in one 2D slice, 
% although it produces 3D segmentation result.

% The 3D MICO algorithm perfoprms 3D segmentation and bias field
% correction, and the segmented image and bias field corrected image are
% saved as two files with file name
